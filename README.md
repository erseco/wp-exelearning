WordPress plugin for eXeLearning content management. Upload, manage and embed eXeLearning `.elpx` files directly in your WordPress site.

## Demo

Try eXeLearning instantly in your browser using WordPress Playground! Note that all changes will be lost when you close the browser window, as everything runs locally in your browser.

## Features

- **ELPX File Support**: Upload and manage eXeLearning `.elpx` files through the WordPress Media Library
- **Automatic Extraction**: ELPX files are automatically extracted and ready to display
- **Embedded Editor**: Edit eXeLearning content directly from WordPress without leaving the browser
- **Gutenberg Block**: Embed eXeLearning content using the native block editor
- **Shortcode Support**: Use `[exelearning id="123"]` to embed content in classic editor
- **Media Library Integration**: View ELPX metadata directly in the media library

## Installation

### From Releases (Recommended)

1. **Download the latest release** from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/erseco/wp-exelearning/releases).
2. Upload the downloaded ZIP file via **Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin**.
3. Activate the plugin.

### From Source (Development)

If you clone the repository directly, you must build the eXeLearning editor:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/erseco/wp-exelearning.git
cd wp-exelearning
make build-editor
```

> **Important:** Cloning the repository without building the editor will show version `0.0.0` and the editor will not work. Always download from [Releases](https://github.com/erseco/wp-exelearning/releases) for production use.

## Usage

### Uploading ELPX Files

1. Go to **Media > Add New** in your WordPress admin
2. Upload your `.elpx` file
3. The file will be automatically validated and extracted

### Embedding Content

**Using Gutenberg Block:**
1. Add a new block in the editor
2. Search for "eXeLearning"
3. Select an ELPX file from your media library

**Using Shortcode:**
```
[exelearning id="123"]
```
Replace `123` with the attachment ID of your ELPX file.

### Viewing ELPX Files

- Go to **Media > Library** to see all uploaded files
- ELPX files display metadata including license, language, and resource type
- Click on an ELPX file to preview its content
